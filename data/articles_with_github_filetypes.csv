The simple code demonstration suggested in this work can be found in the GitHub repository stated in the Data Record section. The code demonstrates the methodology for extraction and subsequent processing of the thermal images. Few images were selected from the dataset for illustration purposes. The code uses two specific GitHub packages: Flirextracter and Labelme. Flirextractor is an efficient Python package for extracting temperature data from thermal images and converting it into an array, then saving it as a CSV file for further access. The link to the GitHub package describing the usage of Flirextractor in detail is as follows: . Labelme is a graphical image annotation tool written in Python. It allows users to demarcate the desired area of any shape with simple mouse clicks. Detailed instructions for Labelme can be found at the following link: . The GitHub code repository exhibits A meticulously structured hierarchy designed to enhance navigation and understandability. It incorporates three primary directories: ‘data’, ‘notebook’, and ‘src’. The ‘data’ directory segregates original, converted, and processed files, whereas the ‘notebook’ directory encompasses Jupyter notebooks detailing file conversion, data visualization, and data analysis procedures. The ‘src’ directory hosts a Python script dedicated to image conversion. Furthermore, the ‘data’ folder manifests a systematic organization structured to efficiently manage different stages of data processing. It consists of three primary subdirectories: ‘original’, ‘convert’, and ‘labelme’. The ‘original’ and ‘processed’ subdirectories mirror each other, containing dated folders representing different acquisition dates, with each date folder further divided into ‘view_1’, ‘view_2’, and ‘view_3’ subdirectories. These subdirectories contain the respective images captured from each view named “smap-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.MS.jpeg”. During the data processing phase, corresponding ‘json’ files for each image are generated in the ‘labelme’ directory. In addition, for each image, a dedicated directory is established within the ‘convert’ subdirectory, encapsulating original, processed, and labeled images and a text file enumerating the detected labels. Detailed file structure tree plots, included within the respective README files, furnish comprehensive visual representations of the file and folder organization, thus facilitating an understanding of the hierarchical structure and interrelationships among different components of the codebase. Moreover, an example involving a representative image has been conducted to illustrate the efficacy of the employed image processing techniques; the results highlight the segmentation, further processing, and final presentation of the image augmented with enhanced colors and informative labels. Please contact the corresponding author directly if you have any particular requirements.","['https://github.com/aloisklink/flirextractor', 'https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme']",2023-12-02,True,True,True,False

The dataset was compiled from a combination of publicly available sources and proprietary, internal repositories. Within this dataset, a subset of 16,693 chest X-ray images underwent meticulous annotation by a team of radiologists, encompassing the delineation of bounding boxes for pathologies spanning 16 distinct categories. For the purposes of this research, the 16k image subset was employed for the fine-tuning and assessment of the AUCReshaping technique.

This dataset comprises a total of 20,000 DICOM images, which correspond to 5000 distinct mammography examinations conducted between the years 2018 and 2020. The selection of these images was performed through random sampling, with a strict de-identification process being applied. Patient metadata, including details such as manufacturers and manufacturers’ model names, is included in the dataset, but notably, it excludes individuals aged 89 years or above. To ensure complete de-identification, patient-specific information present within the images is removed through predefined rectangular cropping. Furthermore, the de-identification process involves a meticulous review by two independent evaluators to ascertain the thorough removal of any patient-related data.

The data in the NHS England OpenSAFELY COVID-19 service is drawn from General Practice data across England TPP is the data processor. TPP developers initiate an automated process to create pseudonymised records in the core OpenSAFELY database, which are copies of key structured data tables in the identifiable records. These pseudonymised records are linked onto key external data resources that have also been pseudonymised via SHA-512 one-way hashing of NHS numbers using a shared salt. University of Oxford, Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science developers and PIs, who hold contracts with NHS England, have access to the OpenSAFELY pseudonymised data tables to develop the OpenSAFELY tools. These tools in turn enable researchers with OpenSAFELY data access agreements to write and execute code for data management and data analysis without direct access to the underlying raw pseudonymised patient data, and to review the outputs of this code. All code for the full data management pipeline—from raw data to completed results for this analysis—and for the OpenSAFELY platform as a whole is available for review at github.com/OpenSAFELY.
